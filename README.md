# Dummy App

A fun little Java Swing application that playfully asks: **"Are you dumb?"** 🧠  
Depending on your answer, you'll either be praised or teased—unless, of course, the "No" button runs away from you!

## Features

- A playful GUI built with Java Swing
- "Yes" and "No" buttons that react differently:
  - Click "Yes": Receive a teasing response ❤️
  - Hover over "No": The button runs away (unless toggled)
  - Click "No" (if you catch it!): Receive a smart compliment 😍
- Right-click anywhere to toggle the "No" button’s run-away behavior
